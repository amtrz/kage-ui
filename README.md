# DSHBRD

DSHBRD is Next.js UI components library that features our vision of Dashboard.

<!-- TODO: add website about this UI lib and it's documentation -->
Take a look at my [CV](https://holakirr.com/ui)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
